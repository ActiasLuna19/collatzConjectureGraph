# collatzConjectureGraph
A program that takes a number and puts it into a collatz sequence until it reaches 1, and graphs the result on a line graph.

### A quick description of the Collatz Conjecture
The collatz conjecture is a famously unsolved math problem that states that every possible postive interger will eveuntally become 1.

The conjecture states that if the interger is even you divide it by two, if the interger is odd then you multpily by three and add one. If you repeat this sequance over and over again, using the interger you find to calculate the next one, you will eventualy get a repeating pattern of 4 2 1. This (according to the collatz conjecture) will always be true no matter what postive inter you start with, weither its 20 or 5,210,637!

Another name, or nickname, for this conjecture is "the 3n + 1 problem". Wich refers to how you calculate the next interger or term if your current one is odd.
