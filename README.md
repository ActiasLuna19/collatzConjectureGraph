# Collatz Conjecture Graph
A program that takes a number and puts it into the collatz conjecture sequence, the program will then graphs the result on a line graph and list the terms on the infobar.

### A quick Description of The Collatz Conjecture
The collatz conjecture is a famously unsolved math problem that states that every possible postive interger will eveuntally become 1.

The conjecture states that if the interger is even you divide it by two, if the interger is odd then you multpily by three and add one. If you repeat this sequance over and over again, using the interger you find to calculate the next one, you will eventualy get a repeating pattern of 4 2 1. This (according to the collatz conjecture) will always be true no matter what postive inter you start with, weither its 20 or 5,210,637!

Another name, or nickname, for this conjecture is "the 3n + 1 problem". Wich refers to how you calculate the next interger or term if your current one is odd.

### More About the Program
In this project, the user will input a number and the program will calculate said numbers collatz conjecture. It will then take this result and graph them in a line graph so the user can get a visual repersentation of how the number changed over the conjecture, as well as put the exsact information on each term and its value in the "information bar" on the right side of the screen.

The information bar, along with the information about the terms, will contain a gerneral discription on what the collatz conjecture is, why it is yet to be solved, and at the very bottom a "reset' Button. The "reset" or "test new number" button found in the information bar will completely reset the program so that the user can input a new number they want to test.

### Future Plans for This
As of now, I consider this project finished. I am happy with the way it looks, runs, and my coding work. 

However in the future I might change some of the code to make it more clean, mostly this would consist of making it so the text in the infobar being in html rather than javascript. This is since I orginally planned on adding the text to the infobar, but since its been a while since I used html, I found it challanging to integrate the two laungages in the way I want.

I dont plan on changing the visuals of the program very much as I like the way it looks and the color scheme, but I may refine the graph, infobar, and button to have more of a profesional/ sharp design. This wont be changing the way it is formated (except maybe making it all fit with the new design), it will only change the general look or feel of the program.
